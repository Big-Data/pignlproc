# pignlproc

Apache Pig utilities to build training corpora for machine learning /
NLP out of public Wikipedia and DBpedia dumps.

## Project status

This project is alpha / experimental code. Features are implemented when needed.
Expects bugs and not implemented exceptions.


## Building from source

Install maven (tested with 2.2.1) and java jdk 6, then:

    $ mvn clean install

This should download the dependencies, build a jar in the target/
subfolder and run the tests.

## Fetching the data

You can get the latest wikipedia dumps for the english articles here (around
5.4GB compressed, 23 GB uncompressed):

  [enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2](http://download.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2)

The DBPedia links and entities types datasets are available here:

  [wikipage_en.nt.bz2](http://downloads.dbpedia.org/3.5.1/en/wikipage_en.nt.bz2)

  [instancetype_en.nt.bz2](http://downloads.dbpedia.org/3.5.1/en/instancetype_en.nt.bz2)

  [longabstract_en.nt.bz2](http://downloads.dbpedia.org/3.5.1/en/longabstract_en.nt.bz2)

  [pagelinks_en.nt.bz2](http://downloads.dbpedia.org/3.5.1/en/pagelinks_.nt.bz2)

  [redirect_en.nt.bz2](http://downloads.dbpedia.org/3.5.1/en/redirect_en.nt.bz2)

All of those datasets are also available from the Amazon cloud as public EBS
volumes:

  [Wikipedia XML dataset EBS Volume](http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=2506): <tt>snap-8041f2e9</tt> (all languages - 500GB)

  [DBPedia Triples dataset EBS Volume](http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=2319): <tt>snap-63cf3a0a</tt> (all languages - 67GB)

It is planned to have crane based utility function to load them to HDFS
directly from the EBS volume.

## Usage

### Building a NER training / evaluation corpus

TODO: Explain howto extract a BIO-formatted corpus suitable for the
training of sequence labeling algorithms such as MaxEnt or CRF
models with [OpenNLP](http://incubator.apache.org/opennlp),
[Mallet](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/) or
[crfsuite](http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite/).

### Building a document classification corpus

TODO: Explain howto extract bag of words / document frequency features suitable
for document classification using a SGD model from
[Mahout](http://mahout.apache.org) for instance.
